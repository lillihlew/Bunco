 * I confirm that the above list of sources is complete AND that I have 
 *  not talked to anyone else about the solution to this problem.*/
 I apologize for the length of the file. I'm showing that you can play with 1 player first, 
  last, after 1, after 2 player, and after 3 player, and I'm doing the same thing with 
  every other number of players. I am sure that the requirements are met within Run One,
  which is why it's at the top. It includes 1 player, 2 player, and 3 player.
